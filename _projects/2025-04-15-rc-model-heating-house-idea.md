I'm starting a new personal project to build an RC (resistor-capacitor) thermal model of a house heating system.

The goal is to create a clear, well-documented notebook that simulates how a basic RC model can approximate indoor temperature dynamics based on radiator activity and external weather conditions.

I'll explore:

- The physical assumptions of the RC model  
- How to structure the equations  
- How to calibrate it using sample data  
- And possibly compare it with data from a real building

Notebook coming soon.
