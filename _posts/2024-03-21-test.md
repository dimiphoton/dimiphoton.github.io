Starting a new website can be overwhelming, but Jekyll and GitHub Pages make it surprisingly straightforward. In this post, I'll share my experience setting up this website and what I learned along the way.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll offers several advantages for developers and content creators:

1. **Simplicity**: Write content in Markdown
2. **Version Control**: Everything is managed through Git
3. **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages hosts your site for free
4. **Security**: Static sites are inherently secure
5. **Speed**: No database means fast loading times

## Getting Started

Here's how I set up this website:

1. Created a new GitHub repository
2. Chose the Minimal Mistakes theme
3. Configured `_config.yml`
4. Created my first posts

## Key Learning Points

- Understanding front matter is crucial
- Local testing saves time
- Organization is key from the start
- Markdown makes writing content easy

## What's Next?

I plan to:
- Add more projects
- Customize the theme
- Implement comments
- Add a newsletter signup

Stay tuned for more updates as this site grows!
